# Deep-Q-Snake
 A Deep Q learning project where the agent learns to play the classic phone game snake. Uses pytorch for the model.<br />
 This program uses pytorch, matplotlib, ipython, and numpy so make sure to install these. <br />
 To run type:<br />
 ```
python3 agent.py
```
This will launch the pygame window as well as the graph. Snake game graphics are defaulted to off. The controls are very simple. To toggle grapics (seeing the snake travel in real time) press space. To toggle wether the agent explores or not press up arrow. Finnaly to save the program after the round ends press down arrow.
